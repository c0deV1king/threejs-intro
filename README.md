This is a for-me repo to learn Three.js. It is following the documentation on [Three.js's website](https://threejs.org/manual/#en/creating-a-scene) <br>
If you are here to learn about me, I was trained as a _Game Artist_ so most of the geometry, texturing and rendering concepts and wording come naturally to me. <br>
The purpose of this is learning the Three.js library and using 3D on the web.
